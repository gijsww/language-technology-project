# Readme Language Technology Project

# Dependencies
Ensure you have installed all the dependencies listed below.
1. fastText https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText (the needed files are downloaded in the notebook)
2. Pytorch https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
3. Scikit Learn https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn
4. NumPy https://github.com/numpy/numpy
5. Jupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/

# Steps to run the main code
Follow these steps to run the code.
1. access the following branch: https://github.com/gijsww/language-technology-project/tree/jupyter-development
2. clone or download the branch
3. open the main.ipynb file with Jupyter Notebook
4. run all the cells in the notebook

# Other code
in addition to our main code, we also developed more systems.
1. Proof of concepts https://github.com/gijsww/language-technology-project/tree/proof_of_concepts. Here we demonstrate with toy data that our main implementation does in fact seem to work.
2. Our main code with added Auto Encoder https://github.com/gijsww/language-technology-project/tree/jupyter-development-ae
3. Conneau https://github.com/gijsww/language-technology-project/tree/jupyter-connea-version. This branch is almost a direct implementation of the existing Conneau et al., code https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE. On the data of our main implementation, we yield similar results to our own code.
